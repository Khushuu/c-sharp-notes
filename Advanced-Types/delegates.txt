# Delegates 

- reference type
- it is a type safe function pointer - it holds reference(pointer) to a function

- the signature of the delegate and the return type should match that of the function, the delegate points to 
- else u will get compiler error 
- that is y delegates are called type safe functions 

- delegate is similar to a class 
- u can create an instance of it and pass the name of function as the parameter to the delegate constructor 
- the delegate will point to this function 

- syntax of delegate is same as that of a method with just delegate keyword

e.g: 

public delegate void PrintDelegate(string message);

public class Babe
{

    public void Main()
    {
        // instantiate an object of delegate by passing method name as parameter
        PrintDelegate printDelegate = new PrintDelegate(Print);
        printDelegate("hello love");
    }

    public static void Print(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(message);
    }
}

Babe babe = new Babe();
babe.Main();

e.g 

// practical usage - using different logic for some common task 

public delegate bool EligibleForPromotionDelegate(CompanyEmployee employee);

public class CompanyEmployee
{

    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Salary { get; set; } 
    public int Experience { get; set; }

    // pass delegate as parameter to invoke different methods

    public static void PromoteEmployee(List<CompanyEmployee> employees, EligibleForPromotionDelegate IsEligibleForPromotion) 
    {
        foreach (CompanyEmployee employee in employees) { 
            
            // this logic to check if an employee is eligible or not for promotion can change
            // use delegate to call different methods to check if an employee is eligible for promotion
            // each method can have its own condition for promotion
            if(IsEligibleForPromotion(employee))
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Promoted Employe: {0}", employee.Name);
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Company 
{
    public static void Main() 
    {
        List<CompanyEmployee> employees =
        [
            new CompanyEmployee { Id = 1, Name = "whatever", Salary = 1000, Experience = 2 },
            new CompanyEmployee { Id = 2, Name = "mary", Salary = 5000, Experience = 5 },
            new CompanyEmployee { Id = 3, Name = "dot", Salary = 3000, Experience = 6 },
            new CompanyEmployee { Id = 4, Name = "com", Salary = 10000, Experience = 8 },
        ];

		// call using different method logics 

        Console.WriteLine("Promotion on the basis of salary: ");
		CompanyEmployee.PromoteEmployee(employees, new EligibleForPromotionDelegate(PromoteBasedOnSalary));

		Console.WriteLine("\nPromotion on the basis of experience: ");
		CompanyEmployee.PromoteEmployee(employees, new EligibleForPromotionDelegate(PromoteBasedOnExperience));

		Console.WriteLine("\nPromotion on the basis of salary and experience: ");
		CompanyEmployee.PromoteEmployee(employees, new EligibleForPromotionDelegate(PromoteBasedOnSalaryAndExperience));

		// using lambda expression 
		CompanyEmployee.PromoteEmployee(employees, emp => emp.Salary >= 6);
    }

    public static bool PromoteBasedOnSalary(CompanyEmployee employee)
    {
        return employee.Salary >= 5000 ? true : false;
    }
    public static bool PromoteBasedOnExperience(CompanyEmployee employee)
    {
        return employee.Experience >= 5 ? true : false;
    }

    public static bool PromoteBasedOnSalaryAndExperience(CompanyEmployee employee)
    {
        return (employee.Experience >= 7 && employee.Salary >= 10000) ? true : false;
    }
}


// Output 
Promotion on the basis of salary:
Promoted Employe: mary
Promoted Employe: com

Promotion on the basis of experience:
Promoted Employe: mary
Promoted Employe: dot
Promoted Employe: com

Promotion on the basis of salary and experience:
Promoted Employe: com
